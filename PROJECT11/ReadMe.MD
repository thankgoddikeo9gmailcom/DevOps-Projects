# Ansible Automatiomation project

## - What is Ansible and why use IT?

#### Ansible is an open source, command-line IT automation software application written in Python.

#### It can configure systems, deploy software, and orchestrate advanced workflows to support application deployment, system updates, and more.

#### Ansible's main strengths are simplicity and ease of use.

#### - Ansible is an automation engine that helps us to automate tasks that are cumbersome, repititive and complex. It makes work easier for the DevOps department.

#### - Ansible Client as a Jump Server (Bastion Host)
#### A Jump Server (sometimes also referred as Bastion Host) is an intermediary server through which access to internal network can be provided.

#### With the current architecture I will be working on, ideally, the webservers would be inside a secured network which cannot be reached directly from the Internet.

#### That means, even DevOps engineers cannot SSH into the Web servers directly and can only access it through a Jump Server - it provides better security and reduces attack surface.

#### On the diagram below the Virtual Private Network (VPC) is divided into two subnets - Public subnet has public IP addresses and Private subnet is only reachable by private IP addresses.

# What is configuration management?
#### Configuration management is a process for maintaining computer systems, servers, applications, network devices, and other IT components in a desired state. Itâ€™s a way to help ensure that a system performs as expected, even after many changes are made over time.

#### Using configuration management tools, administrators can set up an IT system, such as a server or workstation, then build and maintain other servers and workstations with the same settings. IT teams use configuration assessments and drift analyses to continuously identify systems that have strayed from the desired system state and need to be updated, reconfigured, or patched.

#### 5. Test your setup by making  some changes in your README.md file in master branch and make sure that build starts automatically and Jenkins save the  file (build artifacts) in the following folder.

#### ls /var/lib/jenkins/jobs/ansible/builds/<build_number>/archive/
    
#### ls /var/lib/jenkins/jobs/ansible/builds/4/archive/

## Step 2: Prepare your development environment using Visual Studio Code

#### - Download and install VS Code

#### - After successfully installing VS Code, configure it to connect to your newly created GitHub repository.

#### - Clone down the ansible-config-mgt repository to your local machine.

#### - git clone <ansible-config-mgt-repository-link>
#### Git Clone from Git Hub Repo

#### Step 5. Test your setup by making  some changes in your README.md file in master branch and make sure that build starts automatically and Jenkins save the  file (build artifacts) in the following folder.

#### ls /var/lib/jenkins/jobs/ansible/builds/<build_number>/archive/

## Begin Ansible Development.

### Step 3. Begin Ansible Development.
#### 1. In your ansible-config-mgt githup repositoyry, create a new branch that will be used for devolopment of a new feature

#### 2. Checkout the newly created feature branch to your local machine and start building your codes and directory structures.

#### 3. Create a directory call it playbooks, it will be used to store all your directory files.

#### 4. Create a directory call it inventory, it will be used to keep your organized.

#### 5. Within the playbooks folder, create your first playbooks files and name it common.yml

#### 6. Within the inventory folder, create an inventory file for each environment (Development, Staging, Testing and Prodouction) dev, staging, uat, and prod, respectively.

## Step 4. Setup an Ansible Inventory.

#### An inventory file define the host and group of hosts upon which commands, moudles, and task in a playbook operate. Hence the intension is to execute linux command in a remote host, and ensure it is the intended configuration on a particular server that occures. It is important to organize our host in such invetory.

#### Save the below inventory structure in inventory/dev file to start configuring your development servers. Ensure to replace the IP address according to your own set up.

## Note: That ansible uses port 22 by default, which means it has to ssh into a target server from Jenkins-Ansible host,  for this you can impliment the concept of ssh agent. Noe you need to import your key into ssh-agent.

#### eval `ssh-agent -s`

#### ssh-add <path-to-private-key>

#### ssh-add -l 

#### ssh -A ubuntu@public-ip

## Step 5. Create A Common Playbook

#### Create a common playbook

#### update yorur inventory/dev with the below codes.

---
- name: update web, nfs and db servers
  hosts: webservers, nfs, db
  become: yes
  tasks:
    - name: ensure wireshark is at the latest version
      yum:
        name: wireshark
        state: latest
   

 - name: update LB server
  hosts: lb
  become: yes
  tasks:
    - name: Update apt repo
      apt: 
        update_cache: yes

    - name: ensure wireshark is at the latest version
      apt:
        name: wireshark
        state: latest


![alt text](<Screenshot 2024-08-15 124252.png>) s

## Step 6. Update Git with the latest code.

#### Now all your directories and files lives in yoour local machine you need to push all the changes made to Github.

#### Now that you have a separate branch you will need to will need to know how to raise a pull request PR, get your branch peer reviewed and merge to the master branch.

#### Commit your code to Github.

#### 1. Use git command to add, commit and push your branch to Github.

#### git status

#### git add <selected files>

#### git commit -m "commit message"

#### git push origin prj-11

#### 2. Create a pull request, (PR)
#### 3. Wear the hat of another developer for a second and act as a reviewer

#### 4. If the reviewer is happy with your new feature deveopment, merge the code to the master branch.

#### 5. Head back to your terminal and checkout from the feature branch into the master and pull down the latest changes.

#### Once your code change appear in the master- Jenkins will do it's job and save all the file (build artifact) to /var/lib/jenkins/jobs/Ansible/builds/buil_number/archive directory on Jenkin-Ansible server.

![alt text](<Screenshot 2024-08-15 135814.png>) 

#### To confirm that all the file where correctly created in the  /var/lib/jenkins/jobs/Ansible/builds/5/archive, I run the below commands:

#### cd  /var/lib/jenkins/jobs/Ansible/builds/buil_number/archive

#### ls

#### cd inventory

#### ls 

#### cat dev.yml

#### Repeat the same steps for playbooks folder.
